    <p>
      I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate Student at Brown University. I am
      currently taking courses in <em>AI/ML</em> as well as exploring the{" "}
      <em>design and construction of computer systems</em>. I enjoy attending
      hackathons to put my skills to the test!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>I love to learn.</strong> I am never satified with just scratching
      the surface of a subject. When I tackle learning something new, I try to
      dive deep and understand each fundamental concept separately before I try
      to understand it as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>I'm a team player.</strong> I pull my own weight, and I'm
      conscious about making code clean, tested, and well-documented for others.
      I get along well with my peers, and I'm understanding to other people's
      needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>I'm not one to quit.</strong> I'm motivated and like to see things
      through to the end. I'm constantly pushing myself to improve my skills and
      efficiency as a developer.
